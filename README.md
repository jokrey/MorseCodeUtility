# MorseCodeUtility

Utility for a lot's of stuff surrounding morse code.

Allows visually displaying, audibly displaying and interpreting morse code(meaning to turn a binary signal sequence into text).

Similar Encodings (i.e. encodings that are based on a binary "signal on, signal off" kind of logic) can also be easily displayed, encoded and interpreted using this API.

### Installing

* Clone the repository with the 'git clone' command.
(Additionally there are a number of dependencies on the jokrey.utilities.animation package(another repository), so clone that into the path also. However most functionality does not strictly require this.)
* Download one of the released examples (just to play around)
* Download the android app (there is an android app called "Morse Code - Transmit and Receive" [yes, I know that is a bad name], which has some overlap in code base and functionality)

## Features

 * visually displaying morse code
 * audibly displaying morse code
 * interpreting signal sequences into morse code(real time available)

## Usage

* To use the API, follow the java doc
* To use a release - just play around;most functionality is self explanatory
